### Hi there 👋
I come originally from Syria. The experience of war has instilled in me a deeper appreciation for life. As a result, I am always on the hunt for exciting new endeavors to enhance my skills and pursue my passions further. I'm always on the lookout for fresh opportunities for both personal and professional growth. I have recently completed a rigorous nine-week web development bootcamp and am currently enrolled in several web development courses.
